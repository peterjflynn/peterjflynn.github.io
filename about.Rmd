I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. I am advised by Dr. Corrie Moreau, currently a Professor at Cornell University. Prior to graduate school, I graduated from Yale University in 2014 with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

After college, I worked as a Research Assistant at Boston Children's Hospital studying pediatric vaccines. I enjoy thinking about 
evolutionary biology, host-microbe interactions, entomology, microbiology, and the interplay between those fields. Over the years, I've done work in infectious disease, fish phylogenetics, biogeography of ticks and their microbes, and ants and their associated microbes.

When I'm not thinking about ants and microbes, I enjoy cooking and fermenting anything I can find (I guess that is still thinking about microbes). I also enjoy hikes and runs with my dog, playing fetch with my dog, and petting my dog!
