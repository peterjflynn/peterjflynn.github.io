title: "About Me"
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. I am advised by Dr. Corrie Moreau, currently a Professor at Cornell University. Prior to graduate school, I graduated from Yale University in 2014 with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

I study ants and their associated microbes. Specifically for my dissertation, I am aiming to begin to comprehensively address questions of microbial-host dynamics within ants. To do this, I am investigating endogenization of viruses within ant genomes. In addition, I am examining viral and bacterial communities within Neotropical ants along a fragmented gradient. Finally, I am assessing fine-scale bacterial communities within the digestive tract of a specific group of ants.
